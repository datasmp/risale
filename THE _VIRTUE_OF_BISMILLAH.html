<p>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate
And from Him do we seek help.
All praise be to God, the Sustainer of All the Worlds, and blessings
and peace be upon our master Muhammad, and on all his Family
and Companions.
Bismillah, “In the Name of God,” is the start of all things good. We too shall
start with it. Know, O my soul! Just as this blessed phrase is a mark of Islam,
so too it is constantly recited by all beings through their tongues of
disposition. If you want to know what an inexhaustible strength, what an
unending source of bounty is Bismillah, listen to the following story which is
in the form of a comparison. It goes like this:
Someone who makes a journey through the deserts of Arabia has to travel
in the name of a tribal chief and enter under his protection, for in this way he
may be saved from the assaults of bandits and secure his needs. On his own
he will perish in the face of innumerable enemies and needs. And so, two
men went on such a journey and entered the desert. One of them was modest
and humble, the other proud and conceited. The humble man assumed the
name of a tribal chief, while the proud man did not. The first travelled safely
wherever he went. If he encountered bandits, he said: “I am travelling in the
name of such-and-such tribal leader,” and they did not molest him. If he
came to some tents, he was treated respectfully due to the name. But the
proud man suffered indescribable calamities throughout his journey. He both
trembled before everything and begged from everything. He was abased and
became an object of scorn.
My proud soul! You are the traveler, and this world is a desert. Your
impotence and poverty have no limit, and your enemies and needs are
endless. Since it is thus, take the name of the Pre-Eternal Ruler and Post-
Eternal Lord of the desert and be saved from begging before the whole
universe and trembling before every event.
Yes, this phrase is a treasury so blessed that your infinite impotence and
poverty bind you to an infinite power and mercy; it makes your impotence
and poverty a most acceptable intercessor at the Court of One All-Powerful
and Compassionate. The person who acts saying, “In the Name of God,”
resembles someone who enrolls in the army. He acts in the name of the
government; he has fear of no one; he speaks, performs
162 SELECTED READINGS FROM RISALE-I NUR
every matter, and withstands everything in the name of the law and the name of
the government.
At the beginning we said that all beings say “In the Name of God“
through the tongue of disposition. Is that so?
Indeed, it is so. If you were to see that a single person had come and had
driven all the inhabitants of a town to a place by force and compelled them to
work, you would be certain that he had not acted in his own name and
through his own power, but was a soldier, acting in the name of the
government and relying on the power of the king.
In the same way, all things act in the name of Almighty God, for minute
things like seeds and grains bear huge trees on their heads; they raise loads
like mountains. That means all trees say: “In the Name of God“ fill their
hands from the treasury of mercy, and offer them to us. All gardens say: “In
the Name of God,” and become cauldrons from the kitchens of Divine power
in which are cooked numerous varieties of different foods. All blessed
animals like cows, camels, sheep, and goats, say: “In the Name of God,” and
produce springs of milk from the abundance of mercy, offering us a most
delicate and pure food like the water of life in the name of the Provider. The
roots and rootlets, soft as silk, of plants, trees, and grasses say: “In the Name
of God,” and pierce and pass through hard rock and earth.
Mentioning the name of God, the name of the Most Merciful, everything
becomes subjected to them. The roots spreading through hard rock and earth
and producing fruits as easily as the branches spread through the air and
produce fruits, and the delicate green leaves retaining their moisture for
months in the face of extreme heat, deal a slap in the mouths of Naturalists
and jab a finger in their blind eyes, saying: “Even heat and hardness, in
which you most trust, are under a command. For like the Staff of Moses,
each of those silken rootlets conform to the command of, And We said, O
Moses, strike the rock with your staff (Al-Baqarah 2:60) and split the rock.
And the delicate leaves fine as cigarette paper recite the verse “O fire,” We
ordered, “Be cool and peaceful for Abraham!” (Al-Anbiya 21:69) against the
heat of the fire, each like the members of Abraham, peace and blessings be
upon him.
Since all things say: “In the Name of God,” and bearing God’s bounties in
God’s name, give them to us, we too should say: “In the Name of God.” We
should give in the name of God, and take in the name of God. And we should
not take from heedless people who neglect to give in God’s name.
READING THE UNIVERSE THROUGH THE LENSES OF THE QUR’AN
163
Question: We give a price to people, who are like tray-bearers. So what
price does God want, Who is the true owner?
The Answer: Yes, the price the True Bestower of Bounties wants in
return for those valuable bounties and goods is three things: one is
remembrance, another is thanks, and the other is reflection. Saying, “In the
Name of God“ at the start is remembrance, and, “All praise be to God” at the
end is thanks. And perceiving and thinking of those bounties, which are
priceless wonders of art, being miracles of power of the Unique and Eternally
Besought One and gifts of His mercy, is reflection. However foolish it is to
kiss the foot of a lowly man who conveys to you the precious gift of a king
and not to recognize the gift’s owner, it is a thousand times more foolish to
praise and love the apparent source of bounties and forget the True Bestower
of Bounties.
O my soul! If you do not wish to be foolish in that way, give in God’s
name, take in God’s name, begin in God’s name, and act in God’s name. And
that’s the matter in a nutshell!</p>
