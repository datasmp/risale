    "Bismillah, “In the Name of God,” is the start of all things good. We too shall\r",
    "start with it. Know, O my soul! Just as this blessed phrase is a mark of Islam,\r",
    "so too it is constantly recited by all beings through their tongues of\r",

    "unending source of bounty is Bismillah, listen to the following story which is\r",
    "in the form of a comparison. It goes like this:\r",
    "Someone who makes a journey through the deserts of Arabia has to travel\r",
    "in the name of a tribal chief and enter under his protection, for in this way he\r",
    "may be saved from the assaults of bandits and secure his needs. On his own\r",
    "he will perish in the face of innumerable enemies and needs. And so, two\r",
    "men went on such a journey and entered the desert. One of them was modest\r",
    "and humble, the other proud and conceited. The humble man assumed the\r",
    "name of a tribal chief, while the proud man did not. The first travelled safely\r",
    "wherever he went. If he encountered bandits, he said: “I am travelling in the\r",
    "name of such-and-such tribal leader,” and they did not molest him. If he\r",
    "came to some tents, he was treated respectfully due to the name. But the\r",
    "proud man suffered indescribable calamities throughout his journey. He both\r",
    "trembled before everything and begged from everything. He was abased and\r",
    "became an object of scorn.\r",
    "My proud soul! You are the traveler, and this world is a desert. Your\r",
    "impotence and poverty have no limit, and your enemies and needs are\r",
    "endless. Since it is thus, take the name of the Pre-Eternal Ruler and Post-\r",
    "Eternal Lord of the desert and be saved from begging before the whole\r",

    "Yes, this phrase is a treasury so blessed that your infinite impotence and\r",
    "poverty bind you to an infinite power and mercy; it makes your impotence\r",
    "and poverty a most acceptable intercessor at the Court of One All-Powerful\r",
    "and Compassionate. The person who acts saying, “In the Name of God,”\r",
    "resembles someone who enrolls in the army. He acts in the name of the\r",
    "government; he has fear of no one; he speaks, performs\r",

    "the government.\r",
    "At the beginning we said that all beings say “In the Name of God“\r",
    "through the tongue of disposition. Is that so?\r",
    "Indeed, it is so. If you were to see that a single person had come and had\r",
    "driven all the inhabitants of a town to a place by force and compelled them to\r",
    "work, you would be certain that he had not acted in his own name and\r",
    "through his own power, but was a soldier, acting in the name of the\r",
    "government and relying on the power of the king.\r",
    "In the same way, all things act in the name of Almighty God, for minute\r",
    "things like seeds and grains bear huge trees on their heads; they raise loads\r",
    "like mountains. That means all trees say: “In the Name of God“ fill their\r",
    "hands from the treasury of mercy, and offer them to us. All gardens say: “In\r",
    "the Name of God,” and become cauldrons from the kitchens of Divine power\r",
    "in which are cooked numerous varieties of different foods. All blessed\r",
    "animals like cows, camels, sheep, and goats, say: “In the Name of God,” and\r",

    "Moses, strike the rock with your staff (Al-Baqarah 2:60) and split the rock.\r",
    "And the delicate leaves fine as cigarette paper recite the verse “O fire,” We\r",

    "Since all things say: “In the Name of God,” and bearing God’s bounties in\r",
    "God’s name, give them to us, we too should say: “In the Name of God.” We\r",
    "should give in the name of God, and take in the name of God. And we should\r",
